# Welcome to Canonical's Greenhouse Userscripts

## What's this project for

This project contains a set of handful [Userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) (file that ends with `.user.js`), that helps to do some actions on Greenhouse more quickly (like shortcuts).

Here is the list of the available Userscripts:

-   [Greenhouse Application Review](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/greenhouse-browser-scripts/main/application-review.user.js): Add quick rejection buttons to the application review page, to perform rejection with one button click
-   [Greenhouse Application Hotkeys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/greenhouse-browser-scripts/main/application-review-hotkeys.user.js): Add badges and hotkeys to the quick rejection buttons provided by the Greenhouse Applicateion Review script
-   [Greenhouse written interviews in a new tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/greenhouse-browser-scripts/main/written-interview-in-new-tab.user.js): Open written interviews in a new tab instead of downloading "File1.pdf" files
-   [Greenhouse Application Review Helper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/greenhouse-browser-scripts/main/application-review-helper.user.js): Adds additional icons to suggest the quality of the answer for custom application questions
-   [Greenhouse Duplicate Check Helper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/greenhouse-browser-scripts/main/duplicate-check.user.js): If a candidate duplicate tag is detected, the script colors the entire header, so that it is harder to overlook. Also, it opens the duplicate candidate in a new tab so that you can start checking quicker.
-   [Talent Interview Field Reminder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/greenhouse-browser-scripts/main/talent-interview-field-reminder.user.js): Create a reminder to update application custom fields after moving candidates to the Talent Interview stage
-   [To-do expander](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/greenhouse-browser-scripts/main/todo-expander.user.js): Provides a "Reveal all" button to the bulk action set to expand the todo per candidate row
